# Content Manager

Content manager will be responsible to put the eZ Publish installation with the
necessary content for the testing.

ex: we want to test the restore of an object on trash, so to test that we need
first to create the object ( to be more accurate from a 'manually created Content
Type) then send to trash. and only now we can do our test. And after it should
delete the objects to become in the original state.

So this is what Content manager will be responsible.
